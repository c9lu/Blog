			<p>One of the challenges I had with JavaScript is asynchronous programming. Coming from a C# programming background, I am used to seeing code being executed in order. So sometimes when JavaScript doesnâ€™t behave the same way, it becomes a little unpredictable for me.</p>
<p>Prior to Bluebird, I have used .when,&nbsp; .done, .setTimeout to deal with its asynchronous behaviors. Although these methods work, but I find the code can get messy, especially for nested successful callbacks. Since IE11 does not support ECMASCRIPT 6 (which comes with built in promise object), so Bluebird came to the rescue.</p>
<p>The Bluebird built in method Promise.promisify takes in a function variable and returns a promise object; it then chains the subsequent functions you would like to execute, and if any of the functions throw an error, you can catch all of them at once (see lines 8 to 10 below); what is even more effective is that it can execute subsequent code whether there was an error or not (see lines 11-13 below).</p>

<p>Of courses there are cases when we want to execute several methods at once, in this case we use the built in method Promise.all() like below;&nbsp; func1 and func2 run simultaneously,&nbsp; func3 will only execute once func1 and func2 are done.</p>
