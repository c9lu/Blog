<p>Not too long ago, I started reading the book “Clean Code”, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is eager to become a better programmer as it is packed with useful information.</p>
<p>One of the key things I learned is that classes should follow the single responsibility principle. And one of the ways to achieve that is cohesion: the more instance variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. In another word, functions that belong to a class should share the same set of instance variables as much as possible.</p>
<p>A Silverlight portfolio I did back in June had only one class, so I decided to refactor my code so that it follows the single responsibility principle. Here is the basic design I came up with in order to make my code more clean and readable:</p>

<p>You might wonder where do I construct slideshow, video…etc, these are all done in the xaml markup files. I also decided to have 5 xaml files, one for each individual class. It turns out my design is kind of similar to facade design pattern, in the way that Home provides a uniform interface to other classes. Patrick once told me that design pattern is like the solution of how your program can be set up. He advised me to not look into the solution first, instead to think and design the program yourself. And that is what I did in designing this program, however I did try to keep in mind that each class should be as cohesive as possible. Sometimes it is impossible to follow one design pattern to suit your program needs, you might need to apply 2 or more design patterns, therefore it is probably easier to just design it yourself first.</p>
