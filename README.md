The blog service API is built using Express Framework,
https://github.com/c9lu/BlogServer

Unit tests (on the server side): I have added few unit tests (located in the test folder) for saving and retrieving user info via the MongoDB. I am using Mocha framework for testing the asynchronous calls to the database. 

Work in progress, and still in development: Adding units tests on the client side (using Jasmine framework ) for the new blog features - allow user to register/login, add comments and subscribe to posts.
